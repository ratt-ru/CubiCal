Introduction to CubiCal
-----------------------

This is the documentation of CubiCal, a suite of fast calibration routines for radio interferometry.

CubiCal implements several accelerated gain solvers which exploit complex optimisation.
Computationally intensive functions have been written in Numba to further accelerate them and
multiprocessing is fully supported.

This documentation details the necessary steps for installing CubiCal, as well as how to use it.
Additional information on how to get the best performance out of the package is also provided.
