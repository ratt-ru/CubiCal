Parset Options
--------------

This page details available parset options. However, invoking ``gocubical -h``
should be preferred as it will always be up-to-date. The following is broken up
into the various sections of the parset.

.. note::

    These parset options can be specified via command line. For inclusion in a .parset
    file, omit the leading ``--section-`` component and place the remainder in the appropriate
    section.

[data]
######

Options pertaining to data selection and chunking strategy.

--data-ms=string
    Name/path of input measurement set. Mandatory.
--data-column=string
    Name of measurement set column from which to read for input data
    (uncalibrated visibilities). Default: 'DATA'.
--data-time-chunk=string
    Data will be cut up into blocks containing this many timeslots.
    This limits the amount of data processed at once. Smaller chunks
    allow for a smaller RAM footprint and greater parallelism, but this
    sets an upper limit on the solution intervals that may be employed.
    Specify as an integer number of timeslots, or a value with a unit
    (e.g. '300s'). 0 means use full time axis. Default: 32.
--data-freq-chunk=string
    Data will be cut up into blocks containing this many channels.
    This limits the amount of data processed at once. Smaller chunks
    allow for a smaller RAM footprint and greater parallelism, but this
    sets an upper limit on the solution intervals that may be employed.
    Specify as an integer number of channels, or a value with a unit
    (e.g. '128MHz'). 0 means use full frequency axis. Default: 32.
--data-chunk-by=string
    If set, then time chunks will be broken up whenever the value in the
    named column(s) jumps by ``--data-chunk-by-jump``. Multiple column names
    may be given, separated by commas. Set to None to disable. Default:
    SCAN_NUMBER.
--data-chunk-by-jump=int
    The jump size used in conjunction with ``--data-chunk-by``. If 0, then
    any change in value is a jump. If n, then the change must be >n.
--data-rebin-time=string
    Rebin data in time on the fly. Specify as a number of timeslots to average
    together, or a value with a unit (e.g. '5s'). Default: 1
--data-rebin-freq=string
    Rebin data in frequency on the fly. Specify as a number of channels to average
    together, or a value with a unit (e.g. '4MHz'). Default: 1
--data-single-chunk=string
    Each data chunk is assigned a unique identifier, e.g. 'D0T0F0'. If
    set, processes just one chunk of data matching the identifier.
    Primarily a debugging option. No default.

[sel]
#####

Options pertaining to data selection.

--sel-field=int
    FIELD_ID to read from the MS. Default: 0.
--sel-ddid=multi
    DATA_DESC_IDs to read from the MS. Can be specified as e.g. "5",
    "5,6,7", "5~7" (inclusive range), "5:8" (exclusive range), "5:"
    (from 5 to last). Default reads all.
--sel-taql=string
    Additional TaQL selection string. Combined with other selection
    options. No default.
--sel-chan=multi
    Channels to read (within each DDID). Can be specified as e.g. "5",
    "10~20" (10 to 20 inclusive), "10:21" (same), "10:" (from 10 to
    end), ":10:2" (0 to 9 inclusive, stepped by 2), "~9:2" (same).
    Default reads all.
--sel-diag=bool
    Use diagonal (i.e. parallel hand) correlations only. Off-diagonals will
    be null in the outputs. See also --JONES-diag-only.

[model]
#######

Options related to model selection and prediction.

--model-list=multi
    Predict model visibilities from MS column/s and LSM/s (using
    Montblanc). The simplest usage is to specify a column, e.g.
    ``MODEL_DATA``, or a Tigger LSM, e.g. ``skymodel.lsm.html``,
    or, as a special case, ``1`` simply uses unity visibilities.
    (The LSM option is only available if Montblanc is installed).
    Use @TAG, e.g. ``skymodel.lsm.html@dE`` to group sources in the LSM
    by direction, according to the specified tag. You can also specify models
    for different directions by means of a colon. For example,
    ``MODEL_DATA_1:MODEL_DATA_2`` defines two directions, while
    ``MODEL_DATA:skymodel.lsm.html@dE`` defines a direction modelled
    by the ``MODEL_DATA`` column, and other directions as
    defined by the LSM. By contrast, the plus sign adds model visibilities
    together without splitting them into directions, e.g.
    ``MODEL_DATA_1+MODEL_DATA_2:skymodel.lsm.html@dE`` will define
    one direction modelled by a sum of columns, and other directions as
    defined by the LSM. Finally, a comma separates *model sets*. Each model
    set defines a separate minimization problem, weighted differently
    (in which case the --weight-column option must specify the same number
    of comma-separated *weight sets*). The priority of the separators is
    as follows: first, commas split up model sets. Within each set, colons
    split up directions. Finally, within each direction, plus signs split
    up its additive components.
    This can be quite a complex option, so check the log to make sure it is
    being interpreted correctly. No default.
--model-ddes=keyword
    Enables direction-dependent models. If auto, this is determined
    by ``--sol-jones`` and ``--model-list``, otherwise, enable/disable
    explicitly. Keywords: never, auto, always. Default: auto.
--model-beam-pattern=string
    Apply beams from specified .fits files eg. "beam_$(corr)_$(reim).fits"
    or "beam_$(CORR)_$(REIM).fits". No default.
--model-beam-l-axis=keyword
    Specify which axis in the .fits file is associated with the l axis.
    Keywords: X, Y, -X, -Y. No default.
--model-beam-m-axis=keyword
    Specify which axis in the .fits file is associated with the m axis.
    Keywords: X, Y, -X, -Y. No default.
--model-feed-rotate=multi
    Apply a feed angle rotation to the model visibilities. Use 'auto' to
    read angles from FEED subtable, or give an explicit value in degrees.
    Default: auto.
--model-pa-rotate=bool
    Apply parallactic angle rotation to model visibilities. Enable this for
    alt-az mounts, unless your model visibilities are already rotated.
    Default: True.


[weight]
########

Options related to weights.

--weight-column=string
    Column/s to read weights from. Weights are applied by default. Specify an
    empty string or None to disable. Default: WEIGHT_SPECTRUM.
--weight-fill-offdiag=bool
    Fill off-diagonal weights from geometric mean of diagonal weights.
    Use this if you have missing off-diagonal weights for whatever reason.
    Default: False.

    Default: 0.

[degridding]
############

--degridding-Padding=float
    Facet padding factor. Default: 1.7.

[flags]
#######

Options controlling how flags are applied and written to.

--flags-apply=string
    Which flagsets will be applied prior to calibration. Use "-FLAGSET"
    to apply everything except the named flagset ("-cubical" is useful,
    to ignore the flags of a previous CubiCal run). Default: -cubical.
--flags-auto-init=string
    Insert BITFLAG column if it is missing, and initialize a named flagset
    from FLAG and FLAG_ROW. Default: legacy.
--flags-save=string
    Save flags to named flagset in BITFLAG. If none or 0, will not save.
    Default: cubical.
--flags-save-legacy=keyword
    Controls whether output flags are written to FLAG/FLAG_ROW. Is set to 'auto', then
    follows the --flag-save option. Default: auto
--flags-reinit-bitflags=bool
    If true, reninitializes BITFLAG column from scratch. Useful if you ended up
    with a botched one, but be careful what the state of the FLAG/FLAG_ROW column
    is when you use this option. Default: 0.
--flags-warn-thr=float
    If more than this fraction of data is flagged by the solver, issues gentle warnings. Default: 0.3.
--flags-see-no-evil=bool
    Proceed even if flag columns appear to be botched or damaged. Default: 0.


[madmax]
########

"Mad Max" flags visibilities on-the-fly inside the solution loop, by using a MAD filter.
This computes the median absolute residual (i.e. median absolute deviation from zero), and
flags visibilities exceeding the thresholds set below.

--madmax-enable=bool
    Enable Mad Max flagging. Default: 0
--madmax-estimate=keyword
    MAD estimation mode. Use 'corr' for a separate estimate per each baseline and

    or only the 'diag' or 'offdiag' correlations. Default: 'corr'
--madmax-diag=bool
    Flag on on-diagonal (parallel-hand) residuals. Default: 1.
--madmax-offdiag=bool
    Flag on off-diagonal (cross-hand) residuals. Default: 1
--madmax-threshold=list
    Threshold for MAD flagging per baseline (specified in sigmas). Residuals exceeding
    S*MAD/1.428 (where S is the given threshold) will be flagged. MAD is computed per baseline.
    This can be specified as a list e.g. N1,N2,N3,... The first value is used to flag
    residuals before a solution starts (use 0 to disable), the next value is used when the residuals
    are first recomputed during the solution several iteratins later (see -chi-int), etc.
    A final pass may be done at the end of the solution. The last value in the list is reused
    if necessary. Using a list with gradually decreasing values may be sensible. Default: 0,10.
--madmax-global-threshold=list
    Threshold for global MMAD flagging. MMAD is computed as the median of the
    per-baseline MADs. Residuals exceeding S*MMAD/1.428 (where S is the given threshold) will be
    flagged.Can be specified as a list, with the same semantics as --madmax-threshold. Default: 0,12.
--madmax-plot=keyword
    Enable plots for Mad Max flagging. Use 'show' to show figures interactively, or '1'
    to save plots to files instead. Plots will show the worst flagged baseline, and a median flagged
    baseline, provided the fraction of flagged visibilities is above some threshold. Default: 0
--madmax-plot-frac-above=float
    Threshold (in terms of fraction of visibilities flagged) above which Mad Max plots will be generated.
    Default: 0.01.
--madmax-plot-bl=str
    Plot given baseline regardless (multiple baseline IDs may be separated by commas),
    No default.
--madmax-flag-ant=bool
    Flag antennas with excessive residuals, based on MAD criterion. Note that currently
    --madmax-plot must be enabled for this to work. Default: False.
--madmax-flag-ant-thr=float
    Threshold (in sigmas) used to flag bad antennas. Default: 5.

[postmortem]
############

Postmortem flagging is done on things like chi-square statistics after a solutionis finished.

--postmortem-enable=bool

    Intervals with a number of valid point less than X times the median number
    of valid points will be flagged. Default: 0.5.
--postmortem-time-density=float
    If more than the given fraction of data in a timeslot is flagged, flag entire timeslot. Default: 0.5.
--postmortem-chan-density=float
    If more than the given fraction of data in a timeslot is flagged, flag entire channel. Default: 0.5.
--postmortem-ddid-density=float
    If more than the given fraction of data in a DDID is flagged, flag entire DDID. Default: 0.5.

#####

Options pertaining to the solver.

--sol-jones=multi
    Comma-separated list of Jones terms to enable, e.g. "G,B,dE". These
    tags must correspond to the user-defined gain templates at the bottom
    of the .parset file. Default: G.
--sol-precision=keyword
    Solve in single or double precision. Keywords: 32, 64. Default: 32.
--sol-delta-g=float
    Theshold for gain accuracy - gains which improve by less than this value
    are considered converged. Default: 1e-6.
--sol-delta-chi=float
    Theshold for solution stagnancy - if the chi-squared is improving by less
    than this value, the gain is considered stalled. Default: 1e-6.
--sol-chi-int=int
    Number of iterations to perform between chi-suqared checks. This is done to
    avoid computing the expensive chi-squared test evey iteration. Default
--sol-last-rites=bool
    Re-estimate chi-squred and noise at the end of a
    solution cycle. Disabling last rites can save a bit of
    time, but makes the post-solution stats less
    informative. Default: 1.
--sol-stall-quorum=float
    Minimum percentage of solutions which must have
    stalled before terminating the solver. Default: 0.99.
--sol-term-iters=multi
    Number of iterations per Jones term. If empty, then
    each Jones term is solved for once, up to convergence,
    or up to its -max-iter setting. Otherwise, set to a
    list giving the number of iterations per Jones term.
    For example, given two Jones terms and ``--sol-term-iters
    10,20,10`` it will do 10 iterations on the first term,
    20 on the second, and 10 again on the first. No default.

    Only enable this if you really trust the polarisation
    information in your sky model. Default: 0.
--bbc-save-to=str
    Compute suggested BBCs at end of run, and save them to
    the given database. It can be useful to have this
    always enabled, since the BBCs provide useful
    diagnostics of the solution quality (and are not
    actually applied without a load-from setting).
    (default: "{data[ms]}/BBC-
    field:{sel[field]}-ddid:{sel[ddid]}.parmdb")
--bbc-per-chan=bool
    Compute BBCs per-channel (instead of across the entire band).

    "N:K" to start with N and step by K. Default: 0.
--dist-pin-io=bool
    If not 0, pins the I/O & Montblanc process to a
    separate core, or cores (if ``--montblanc-threads`` is
    specified). Ignored if ``--dist-pin`` is not set.
    Default: 0.
--dist-pin-main=keyword
    If set, pins the main process to a separate core. If
    set to "io", pins it to the same core as the I/O
    process, if I/O process is pinned. Ignored if ``--dist-
    pin`` is not set. Keywords: 0, 1, io. Default: io.

[out]
#####

Options controlling output locations and types.

    Allow overwriting of existing output files. If this is
    set, and the output parset file exists, will raise an exception.
    Default: False.
--out-backup=bool
    Allow automatic backup of existing output directories. Automatic backup
    is only used when OUTDIR is used (i.e. OUTNAME doesn't contain any slashes),
    and it ends with .cc-out (implicitly or explicitly). In this case, existing
    output directories are renamed to .cc.out.0, .1, etc. Default: True.
--out-mode=keyword

--out-subtract-model=int
    Index of model to subtract, if generating residuals.
    Default: 0.
--out-subtract-dirs=multi
    Which model directions to subtract, if generating
    residuals. ":" subtracts all. Can also be specified as

    Invoke pdb before entering the solver. Default: 0.

[gainterm]
##########

Options pertaining to a specific gain term. This is not a unique section in the parset.
Each gain term specified in ``--sol-jones`` must have a (not necessarily complete) section
like this one. For the example given in ``--sol-jones``, there should be three separate
sections like this, one for [g], [b] and [de] respectively. Their options will be specified
by ``--g-``, ``--b-`` and ``--de-`` respectively.

--gainterm-solvable=bool
    Set to 0 (and specify -load-from or -xfer-from) to
    load a non-solvable term from disk. Not to
    be confused with ``--sol-jones``, which determines the
    active Jones terms. Default: 1.
--gainterm-type=keyword
    Type of Jones matrix to solve for. Note that if
    multiple Jones terms are enabled, then only complex-
    2x2 is supported. Keywords: complex-2x2, complex-diag,
    phase-diag, robust-2x2, f-slope, t-slope, tf-plane.
    Default: complex-2x2.
--gainterm-load-from=str
    Load solutions from given database. The DB must define
    solutions on the same time/frequency grid (i.e. should
    normally come from calibrating the same
    pointing/observation). By default, the Jones matrix
    label is used to form up parameter names, but his may
    be overridden by adding an explicit "//LABEL" to the
    database filename. No default.
--gainterm-xfer-from=str
    Transfer solutions from given database. Similar to
    ``-load-from``, but solutions will be interpolated onto
    the required time/frequency grid, so they can
    originate from a different field (e.g. from a
    calibrator). (default: )
--gainterm-save-to=str
    Save solutions to given database. Default: {data[ms]}
    /{JONES}-field:{sel[field]}-ddid:{sel[ddid]}.parmdb.

    ``--model-ddes`` must be enabled. Default: 0.
--gainterm-fix-dirs=multi
    For DD terms, makes the listed directions non-
    solvable. No default.
--gainterm-update-type=keyword

    solver type, but restricts the update rule to pin the
    solutions within a certain subspace: 'full' is the
    default behaviour; 'diag' pins the off-diagonal terms
    to 0; 'phase-diag' also pins the amplitudes of the
    diagonal terms to unity; 'amp-diag' also pins the
    phases to 0. Keywords: full, phase-diag, diag, amp-diag.

    Amplitude clipping - flag solutions with diagonal
    amplitudes below this value. Default: 0.1.
--gainterm-clip-high=float
    Amplitude clipping - flag solutions with any
    amplitudes above this value. 0 disables. Default:

    Maximum number of iterations spent on this term.
    Default: 20.
--gainterm-epsilon=float
    Convergence threshold. Solutions that change by less than this value
    are considered converged. Default: 1e-6.
--gainterm-delta-chi=float
    Threshold for solution stagnancy -- if the chi-squared is improving by less
    (relatively), then the solution is marked as stalled. Default: 1e-6.
--gainterm-conv-quorum=float
    Minimum percentage of converged solutions to accept.
    Default: 0.99.
--gainterm-ref-ant=int
    Reference antenna - its phase is guaranteed to be
    zero. Default: None.
--gainterm-prop-flags=keyword
    Flag propagation policy. Determines how flags raised
    on gains propagate back into the data. Options are
    'never' to never propagate, 'always' to always
    propagate, 'default' to only propagate flags from
    direction-independent gains. Keywords: never, always,
    default. Default: default.
--gainterm-estimate-pzd=bool
    Estimate phase-zero difference and initialize the gains with it.
    Use for polarization calibration. Default: False.
--gainterm-diag-only=bool
    Use only diagonal (parallel-hand) data and model terms for the solution.
    Note that gains are still applied to the full 2x2 data (unless
    --sel-diag is also set). Default: False.
--gainterm-offdiag-only=bool
    Use only off-diagonal data and model terms for the solution, and only solve
    for off-diagonal Jones elements, pinning the on-diagonals to 1. Default: False.
--gainterm-robust-cov=keyword
    Determines how the residuals covariance matrix is computed if the robust-2x2
    solver is selected. Options are 'compute' to compute normaly, 'identity' to set the
    covariance to 1 (identity matrix) as in the Robust-t paper, and
    'hybrid' which is the default computes the covaraince matrix C but sets
    it to 1 if the elements are greater than 1. Keywords: compute | identity | hybrid.
--gainterm-robust-scale=bool
    Scales down the residuals covariance matrix. Simulations show that this
    improves the results with unmodelled sources. Default: True.
--gainterm-robust-npol=int
    The number of correlations (polarizations) actually present in the visibilities.
    This option only applies if the robust-2x2 solver is selected. Expectings 2 or 4 correlations.
    Default: 2.
--gainterm-robust-int=int
    Number of iterations after which the v-parameter is recomputed for the robust solver.
    Default: 1.
--gainterm-robust-save-weights=bool
    Determines if the appied weights from the robust-2x2 solver are stored.
    This option only applies if the robust-2x2 solver is selected. If this option is set,
    output-weight-column must be set too. Default: False.
