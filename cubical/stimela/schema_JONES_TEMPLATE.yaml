JONES_TEMPLATE:
  solvable:
    info: Set to 0 (and specify -load-from or -xfer-from) to load a non-solvable term
      is loaded from disk. Not to be confused with --sol-jones, which determines the
      active Jones terms.
    required: false
  type:
    info: Type of Jones matrix to solve for. Note that if multiple Jones terms are
      enabled, then only complex-2x2 is supported.
    required: false
  delay-estimate-pad-factor:
    info: Integer by which the bandwidth will be multiplied for padding the FFT. Used
      in the f-slope solver to make an initial guess of delay values.

    dtype: int
  load-from:
    info: Load solutions from given database. The DB must define solutions on the
      same time/frequency grid (i.e. should normally come from calibrating the same
      pointing/observation). By default, the Jones matrix label is used to form up
      parameter names, but his may be overridden by adding an explicit "//LABEL" to
      the database filename.
    required: false
  xfer-from:
    info: Transfer solutions from given database. Similar to -load-from, but solutions
      will be interpolated onto the required time/frequency grid, so they can originate
      from a different field (e.g. from a calibrator).
    required: false
  save-to:
    info: Save solutions to given database.
    required: false
  dd-term:

  update-type:
    info: 'Determines update type. This does not change the Jones solver type, but
      restricts the update rule to pin the solutions within a certain subspace: ''full''
      is an unrestricted 2x2 solution; ''diag'' pins the off-diagonal terms to 0;
      ''scalar'' makes the diagonal terms equal; ''phase-diag'' or ''phase-scalar''
      pins the amplitudes to unity; ''amp-diag'' or ''amp-scalar'' pins the phases
      to 0; ''pzd-diag'' allows for a diagonal phase-zero-difference (PZD) term only;
      ''leakage'' allows complex off-diagonal leakages and pins the diagonals to 1;
      ''pzd-leakage'' allows complex off-diagonal leakages and a diagonal PZD term;'

  diag-only:

  robust-cov:
    info: Determines how the residuals covariance matrix is computed if the robust-2x2

      set the covariance to 1 (identity matrix) as in the Robust-t paper, and 'hybrid'
      which is the default computes the covaraince matrix, C but sets it to 1 if the
      elements are greater than 1.
    required: false
  robust-scale:
    info: Scales down the residuals covariance matrix by this factor. Simulations
